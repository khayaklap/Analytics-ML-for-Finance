## Introduction 

Hello, my name is Khai-Lap, and this is my GitHub repository. I am a 4th year undergraduate student majoring in finance and analytics at McGill University. Having taken boring investment banking focused classes with a heavy emphasis on Excel, I realized that my passion lies in a more logical & mathematical approach to finance, where insights are derived by understanding the underlying data rather than making baseless assumptions. I have not looked back since, and hope to share what I have learned so far. I am in no way a good coder or a quant, nor do I think I will be one in the near future, as you will see in my code.
