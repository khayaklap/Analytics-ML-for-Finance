## Introduction 
<hr style="border: 0.25px solid black;">

Hello, my name is Khai-Lap, and this is my GitHub repository. I am a 4th year undergraduate student majoring in finance and analytics at McGill University. Having taken boring investment banking focused classes with a heavy emphasis on Excel, I realized that my passion lies in a more logical & mathematical approach to finance, where insights are derived by understanding the underlying data rather than making baseless assumptions. I have not looked back since, and hope to share what I have learned so far. I am in no way a good coder or a quant, nor do I think I will be one in the near future, as you will see in my code.

## Objective
<hr style="border: 0.25px solid black;">

This repository demonstrates applications of different subsets of machine learning in trading, portfolio optimization, and risk management, using Python. Beyond tuning hyperparameters and making predictions, we will dig into the maths behind the convergence process of each algorithm, as well as its strengths & weaknesses. This will allow us to apply relevant feature engineering techniques to feed clean data into our models and make trustworthy deductions. Methodologies covered include EDA & preprocessing, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, and (deep) reinforcement learning.
